  The organization was founded on July 23, 2004 by Sam Mathews with the help of Anne Mathews and Nader Atoui. Fnatic has won the eSports Award Team of The Year in 2006, and 2009. During 2007-2008 Fnatic welcomed Neil Kirk (co-founder of TCM-Gaming). After playing several years for Fnatic, Patrik "cArn" Sättermon, one of the best CS:1.6 players became the Chief Gaming Officer of Fnatic in 2012. Since 2013, Anne Mathews took over the position of Sam Mathews as the CEO of Fnatic. Sam Mathews still remains as a Chairman in the organisation.

In the September of 2008, Fnatic acquired sponsors MSI and SteelSeries. At that point, Fnatic became known as FnaticMSI. Recently, Fnatic and MSI announced the MSI Beat It! tournament. The world's largest Counter Strike: Global Offensive competition. On the first of June, 2011, EIZO started to sponsor Fnatic.

In January 2012, Fnatic took on RaidCall as a sponsor. However this didn’t mean the end of partnership with MSI, as they continue to provide the organization with laptops, graphics cards, and motherboards. With the new title Sponsor, Fnatic was able to expand their territory into the Korean gaming scene, as they became the first foreign e-sports team to acquire a Professional Gaming House in Seoul, South Korea. Fnatic and RaidCall quit their collaboration in early 2013 and soon after the online Poker site Winamax was introduced as a new sponsor. In 2013, Alexander Zavoloka, a common face in the Russian e-sports scene, stepped down from the position as the Editor-in-Chief and got replaced by Andreja Mahovic, a former Dota 2 professional.
